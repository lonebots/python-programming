'''
Given an integer n, return the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to n.

A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, 1, 4, 9, and 16 are perfect squares while 3 and 11 are not.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 12
Output: 3
Explanation: 12 = 4 + 4 + 4.

Example 2:

Input: n = 13
Output: 2
Explanation: 13 = 4 + 9.

    def numSquares(self, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
        dp[0] = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            min_val = float('inf')
            j = 1
            while j * j <= i:
                min_val = min(min_val, dp[i - j * j] + 1)
                j += 1
            dp[i] = min_val
        return dp[n]
