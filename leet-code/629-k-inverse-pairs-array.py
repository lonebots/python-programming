'''
For an integer array nums, an inverse pair is a pair of integers [i, j] where 0 <= i < j < nums.length and nums[i] > nums[j].

Given two integers n and k, return the number of different arrays consist of numbers from 1 to n such that there are exactly k inverse pairs. Since the answer can be huge, return it modulo 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 3, k = 0
Output: 1
Explanation: Only the array [1,2,3] which consists of numbers from 1 to 3 has exactly 0 inverse pairs.

Example 2:

Input: n = 3, k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The array [1,3,2] and [2,1,3] have exactly 1 inverse pair.

 

Constraints:

    1 <= n <= 1000
    0 <= k <= 1000

        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        dp = [[0] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

                    dp[i][j] = 1
                else:
                    val = (dp[i - 1][j] + MOD - (dp[i - 1][j - i] if j - i >= 0 else 0)) % MOD
                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j - 1] + val) % MOD

        return (dp[n][k] + MOD - (dp[n][k - 1] if k > 0 else 0)) % MOD
