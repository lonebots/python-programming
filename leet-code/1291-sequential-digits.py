'''
An integer has sequential digits if and only if each digit in the number is one more than the previous digit.

Return a sorted list of all the integers in the range [low, high] inclusive that have sequential digits.

 

Example 1:

Input: low = 100, high = 300
Output: [123,234]

Example 2:

Input: low = 1000, high = 13000
Output: [1234,2345,3456,4567,5678,6789,12345]

 

Constraints:

    10 <= low <= high <= 10^9
