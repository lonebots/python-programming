# Python Notes :

Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.

Conventions in python

1.  `_` usage :

        - To hold the result of the last executed expression in an interactive interpreter session

        - For translation lookup in i18n (see the gettext documentation for example), as in code like

              raise forms.ValidationError(_("Please enter a correct username"))

        - As a general purpose "throwaway" variable name
