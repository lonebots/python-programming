Good understanding of DSA is required for solving problems as well as becoming a good software engineer. I am sharing some of my learning experience with DSA over here.

- The fundamentals of dsa include the following
  - Data strucutres
    - Array
      - single dimentional - list
      - multi dimentional
    - linked list
    - stack
    - queue
- advanced
  - heap
    -
  - tree
    - normal tree
