### Data Structures and Algorithms notes

Good understanding of DSA is required for solving problems as well as becoming a good software engineer. I am sharing some of my learning experience with DSA over here.

- The fundamentals of dsa include the following

  - **Data strucutres**
    It is way of storing data in device for efficient and effective usage(minimize space and time complexity). some common datastructures are 
    - Array - linear datastructure with continuous memory allocation, access time is O(1) its types are :
      - single dimentional - list
      - multi dimentional
