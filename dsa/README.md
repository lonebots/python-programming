## This repository contains a summary of my learnings of DSA using python

**Folder strutures**

```

|--> datastructures/
|--> algorithms/
|--> notes/
|--> problems/

```

Different folders contains contents that are pretty much self explanatory with comments and respective notes can be found in the notes folder.
